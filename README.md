# liri-node-app

In this project, I made a Siri like Liri command line node app where users can put in certain commands to retrieve Tweets, Song details from Spotify and movie info from Omdb.

You can use one of the four commands:

- my-tweets
- spotify-this-song
- movie-this
- do-what-it-says

Have fun!
